# Research Projects & Publications

Here are some of my recent projects and publications:

## Example Project 1

**"Evolving Magnetic Field and Ohmic Heating in Photoevaporating Hot-Saturns"**

A project using MESA to model ohmic heating, with self-consistent magnetic field dynamo calculations, in Saturn-mass exoplanets.

  <p>
  In this project, we reevaluated ohmic heating as a valuable mechamism for radial inflation of expoplanetary models, specifically with a full magnetic field profile. This allowed for the first and accurate assessment of the dynamo region and subsequently and convective flux regions, in which we use to calculate the evolution B field dip values seen in my other repository.
