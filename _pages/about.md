I am a senior studying Astronomy & Astrophysics at the Florida Institute of Technology.  
My research interests include **exoplanet atmospheres**, **stellar evolution**, and **computational astrophysics**.  

I use modeling tools like **MESA** and data from the **NASA Exoplanet Archive** to investigate the evolution of planetary systems.
