excerpt: "Re-evaluated ohmic heating as a mechanism of radial inflation with a self-consistent magnetic field profile, and parameter space defined by orbital separation, variable core masses, and atmospheric evaporation."

In this project, I utilized MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) to model 60, 80, and 100 Earth-mass planets. I evaluated radial inflation in each model within the parameter space defined above.

Tools: Python, MESA, Matplotlib, FORTRAN
